                        <h2>The Paradise of North Sumatera</h2>
                        <p>Please be advised that this is not an actual UI/UX project; rather, it serves as my initial experimentation with Figma. I have endeavored to utilize prototype animation in its projection. 'The Paradise Of North Sumatra' denotes a website aimed at reviewing the scenic splendor of North Sumatra, and my aim was to craft its UI/UX within Figma as part of this experimental process. I reiterate that this endeavor is solely an experiment and does not represent a formal or serious project in conventional terms.</p>

                        <h2>Istana Maimoon Tour Guide</h2>
                        <p>This captivating UI/UX design is the brainchild of a collaborative effort between myself and two ingenious companions, Faisal and Bagas, during our college semester project. Our endeavor revolved around conceptualizing a website dedicated to Maimoon Palaceâ€”a virtual tour guide tailor-made for adventurous souls seeking to unravel the mysteries and wonders of this historical marvel. With an aim to captivate and educate, our creation beckons tourists to embark on a digital journey, delving deep into the rich tapestry of Maimoon Palace's heritage and allure.</p>

                        <h2>My Second Web Portfolio Design</h2>
                        <p>This is also my first attempt at UI/UX. The website page you are currently on is my second portfolio website. The first one I made using Bootstrap. And what you see above is the first design concept of my current web portfolio with a mix of yellow with dark grey before changing to dark grey and orange. This current design I did not use UI/UX design planning and just designed it. This first concept design I made with the help of my friend, Paiz. He is very kind to me. He is the one who taught me about Figma with practical methods. And this is his web portfolio link <a href="https://zazaaw.github.io/#">zazaaw.github.io</a></p>

                        <h2>BAF Technology Store</h2>
                        <p>Similar to Istana Maimoon Tour Guide, BAF Technology is also a semester project lab but it belongs to three of my friends. I only helped them create the UI/UX Design and they did the coding. This is where I started to open the gates of my new skills. After washing my eyes on pinterest, I was suddenly able to make that kind of UI/UX Design. I even created the login page in less than an hour. This proves to myself that my skills, art, and creativity in the world of UI/UX Design have improved.</p>
