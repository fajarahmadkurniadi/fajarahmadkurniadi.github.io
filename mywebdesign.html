                        <h2>My First Portfolio Website</h2>
                        <p>This is what my first website portfolio looks like. What you are opening is my second website portfolio. I made the website using the Bootstrap framework and I didn't make the UI/UX Design first because I made this by looking at tutorials from YouTube and the channel is called "Web Programming UNPAS" with the mentor being my own lecturer, Shandika Galih. Hahaha people who see my first web portfolio design will definitely be familiar that it is a design from Shandika Galih taught in the tutorial. Because the video tutorial is like a saviour for IT students to learn the web. If you want to visit it, here is the link <a href="https://fajarahmadkurniadi.github.io/">fajarahmadkurniadi.github.io</a></p>

                        <h2>Istana Maimoon Tour Guide</h2>
                        <p>Embark on an immersive journey through the corridors of history with this website devoted to Maimoon Palace-a dazzling virtual tour guide carefully crafted for intrepid explorers who wish to uncover the splendour of this architectural gem. As mentioned earlier, this website serves as a testament to my academic endeavours, carefully crafted as a prototype to showcase my prowess in digital design. However, it is important to clarify that these digital marvels are still limited to the academic world so this website is not hosted.</p>

                        <h2>This one you opened</h2>
                        <p>My second portfolio, unlike its predecessor, took shape without the initial implementation of UI/UX design principles. Similar to the genesis of my inaugural portfolio, this digital masterpiece emerged from the crucible of online learning, sculpted through the guidance of video tutorials sourced from the vast repository of YouTube. However, this rendition underwent a metamorphosis of its own, infused with bespoke modifications and personalized touches to tailor-fit its essence to my evolving vision. While devoid of the structured framework of UI/UX design at its inception, this portfolio stands as a testament to my adaptability and ingenuity, a fusion of curated knowledge and intuitive creativity birthed in the boundless expanse of the digital realm.</a></p>

                        <h2>BAF Technology Store</h2>
                        <p>Similar to Istana Maimoon Tour Guide, BAF Technology is also a semester project lab but it belongs to three of my friends. I only helped them create the UI/UX Design and they did the coding. This is where I started to open the gates of my new skills. After washing my eyes on pinterest, I was suddenly able to make that kind of UI/UX Design. I even created the login page in less than an hour. This proves to myself that my skills, art, and creativity in the world of UI/UX Design have improved.</p>
